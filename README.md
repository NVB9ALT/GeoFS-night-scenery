# GeoFS-night-scenery

This adds night scenery to GeoFS for players who have water effects off, as city lights and such are part of the water effects for some reason. Terrain imagery brightness is increased as well as scene light to create a cockpit lighting effect. However, since a major plank of it is based on terrain imagery brightness, this may cause bright deserts and snowy mountains to become unnaturally bright at night.

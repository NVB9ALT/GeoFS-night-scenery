# GeoFS-night-scenery

This adds night scenery to GeoFS for players who have water effects off, as city lights and such are part of the water effects for some reason. However, because the 2.9 blackMarble imagery isn't very visible in 3.31+ at night, terrain imagery brightness is increased as well. So be advised: using this addon will cause bright deserts and snowy mountains to become unnaturally bright at night.

PLEASE NOTE: This addon will not run if you have advanced atmosphere on, because I couldn't get the terrain imagery brightness adjustments to work properly with advanced atmosphere lighting. If you have advanced atmosphere on you probably also have enough spare FPS to have water effects on, but some people don't do what you expect them to, so here we are.

This is a bookmarklet addon. A tutorial on how to install and run bookmarklets is available on my YouTube channel, "NVB9 2". If you have installed the realism addon you are hopefully familiar with this.

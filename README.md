# GeoFS-night-scenery

This adds night scenery to GeoFS for players who have water effects off, as city lights and such are part of the water effects for some reason. However, because the 2.9 blackMarble imagery isn't very visible in 3.31+ at night, terrain imagery brightness is increased as well. So be advised: using this addon will cause bright deserts and snowy mountains to become unnaturally bright at night.

This is a bookmarklet addon. A tutorial on how to install and run bookmarklets is available on my YouTube channel, "NVB9 2". If you have installed the realism addon you are hopefully familiar with this.
